## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Robinhood
  - Ability to login using Face ID
  - Being able to add stocks to different lists to look at seperately

Instagram
  - Ability to choose whether number of likes is displayed or not
  - Reccomendation posts tab

Snapchat
 - Able to see where friends are with Snap Map
 - Able to get reccomendations for popular things to do where you are

An idea for an app I have is an app that based on your preferred airport will filter through all flights to any airport in the world and return you a list of the cheapest flights on any date. You would be able to apply filters like by continent, dates, price, or timings. This could be used for spontaneous travel to a random location. You would also be able to book the flights directly through the app.
